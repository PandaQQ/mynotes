# System Analysis and Design 工作记录


## 2. Current Environment Description

> 在获取用户需求之前，先对现有系统进行分析评估。 就算事经验丰富的PM团队都会直接踩入到用户需求分析，反而忘记了对现有系统评估和分析，以至到了用户分析阶段。技术团队和用户方无法达成一致。下面会具体描述其中各个部分的定义和描述：

```text
2.1  Current System Overview
<Include a high level diagram showing the interactions between the system and the user, as well as any interfaces or interactions between the system and external systems/parties.>
<Diagram for high level system overview.> 

2.1.1 High level system overview:
Subsystem	Function
<List the subsystems>	
<List the functions>

2.1.2 Current System Hardware, Software and Network
<Describe the current system's hardware and software configuration.>
System hardware:
Hardware	
Server Name	
CPU	
Memory	
Hard Disk Storage	

System software:
Software	
Operating System	
Application Server Software	
Backup Software	

<This section contains the high level system network diagram and its descriptions.>
<High level system network diagram.>

2.1.3 Volumes and Frequencies
<Summarise the data volumes and frequencies of processes of the current system.>
Data volume and frequencies:
Subsystem	Description	Volume and Frequencies
<List the subsystems>	<Description of the subsystems>	<Description>

2.1.4 Interface with Other Systems
<Describe any current system interfaces.>
System interfaces:
Interface	External Parties	Description
<List the interface>	<List the parties>	<Description>
		
2.2  Current Business Model
<Include the model of current business process and follow by a table/paragraph to elaborate the process if needed. Typically, the major elements that need to be captured in the Process Diagrams are:
Event 
Denote something that happens  
Activity 
Describe the kind of work that needs to be performed 
Gateway 
Describe the decision factors and determines where the next step should go 
Connections 
Describe how the process flow objects are connected.>

<User type as well as the system / process boundary can also be included in a swim lane diagram. A complex business process can be broken down into sub-level if needed.>
<Business process diagram(s).>

2.3  Current Problems and Issues
<Provide the problems and issues encountered by the business or IT currently.>
Problems and issues:
No.	Description
<Unique number>	<Description>
